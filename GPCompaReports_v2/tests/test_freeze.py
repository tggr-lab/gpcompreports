"""The PI approved the v2 report pages. With every V3 toggle off, the content
inside the report sections must be what it was.

This used to compare a freshly built demo report against
GPCompaReports_v2/output/reports/par2_human.html directly. That directory is
gitignored: a routine `python3 generate_site.py` (no --output) overwrites it,
after which the test would compare the branch against itself and pass
forever, silently, on the one property this whole test exists to guard.

The baseline now lives in a git-tracked fixture,
tests/fixtures/freeze_manifest.json, generated deliberately by
scripts/build_freeze_manifest.py from a pristine pre-V3 build and reviewed
by hand before being committed. This test only ever reads that fixture; it
never regenerates it.

"Approved content" = the inner HTML of every <section class="report-section">
element, in document order, not including the opening tag. The V3 branch adds
id= and data-section-title= to that opening tag deliberately (sanctioned
wayfinding); everything inside the tag is the PI-approved content that must
not move. This regex and separator must be kept identical to the copy in
scripts/build_freeze_manifest.py, or the manifest and this test will
silently disagree about what "approved content" means.
