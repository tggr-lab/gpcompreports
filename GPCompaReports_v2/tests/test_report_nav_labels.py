"""The report section-nav labels are pinned here, not by the freeze test.

`data-section-title` sits on the opening tag of each report section, and the
freeze manifest's scope is the inner HTML *excluding* that tag. So the content
hash is blind to these labels: it would not have caught the approved change
from "Complete RRCS" to "RRCS results", and it would not catch an unapproved
one either.

The approved correction covers exactly one label. Everything else is pinned to
the order and wording it already had.
