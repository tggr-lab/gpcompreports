"""The RRCS table is capped at 1,000 rows, and the page has to say so.

The freeze test reverses the approved edit before hashing, and its delete rule
matches the note whatever numbers it carries. That is correct for a baseline
guard but means the freeze cannot catch a wrong total. This file does.

Approved change: the heading "Complete RRCS results" became "RRCS results",
and reports whose table is truncated carry one line under it giving the real
total. Everything else in the section is unchanged.
