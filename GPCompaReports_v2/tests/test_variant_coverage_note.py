"""The four receptors without variant data are not one story, and the page
must not tell them as one.

Two of them, NPY6R and TAAR3, are annotated pseudogene loci: gnomAD carries
variants at those loci but none with a protein-coding missense consequence, so
there is nothing to place on a residue. Zero is the correct answer.

The other two, GP182 and P2RY8, are a data-collection limitation. gnomAD does
hold missense variants for both. They are absent from this release's variant
dataset because their identifiers were not resolved when it was collected, and
that is recorded for a later manuscript revision rather than patched here.

Collapsing all four into one "no data available" line would state something
false about GP182 and P2RY8. These tests fail if that happens.
