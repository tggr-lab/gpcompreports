"""Generate the Contact page.

The form posts to Formspree over plain HTML: a real <form action> with
method="POST". No JavaScript, no npm package, no AJAX helper.

The template disables the form whenever this endpoint still starts with
"FORMSPREE_", so a placeholder can never ship looking live. That guard stays.

Spam protection beyond the _gotcha honeypot (Formspree CAPTCHA and "Restrict
to Domain") is dashboard configuration, not code, and is recorded as a manual
release check in docs/superpowers/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md.

#: The form's notifications are delivered to the lab account. That routing
#: is a Formspree dashboard setting, not a value this module controls, and
#: the address is deliberately not rendered on the page: visitors use the
#: form, and a published mailto is an invitation to scrapers.
